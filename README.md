TVHeadend iOS Library 
=======================

This library is a split from the model code from TvhClient. The code is now independent of the application, which means it can be used anywhere. 

TvhClient is now dependent of this library. 

TvhClient is a TVHeadend iOS (iPhone, iPad) Client app, which allows you to remote control the TVHeadend server  ( https://github.com/tvheadend/tvheadend ) - a DVB receiver, DVR and streaming server.

## Getting the code

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/zipleen/tvheadend-ios-lib.git
